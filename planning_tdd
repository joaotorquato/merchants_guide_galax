Merchant's Guide To The Galaxy

The numbers used for intergalactic transactions follows similar convention to the roman
numerals and you have painstakingly collected the appropriate translation between them

The symbols "I", "X", "C", and "M" can be repeated three times in succession, but no more. (They
may appear four times if the third and fourth are separated by a smaller value, such as XXXIX.)
"D", "L", and "V" can never be repeated.
"I" can be subtracted from "V" and "X" only. "X" can be subtracted from "L" and "C" only. "C" can
be subtracted from "D" and "M" only. "V", "L", and "D" can never be subtracted.
Only one small-value symbol may be subtracted from any large-value symbol.

Based on this, I create the tests for the TDD for Roman Numerals:

1     - I
2     - II
3     - III
4     - IV
5     - V
9     - IX
10    - X
20    - XX
30    - XXX
39    - XXXIX
40    - XL
50    - L
90    - XC
100   - C
200   - CC
300   - CCC
390   - CCCXC
400   - CD
500   - D
900   - CM
1000  - M
2000  - MM
3000  - MMM
3900  - MMMCM
